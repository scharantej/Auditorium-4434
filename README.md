## Flask Application Design for Dashboard

### HTML Files

- **index.html**:
   - The main page that displays the dashboard with charts, graphs, and other visualizations.
   - Includes a Bootstrap header, sidebar, and main content area.
- **audit_details.html**:
   - A modal window that pops up when a user clicks on an audit in the dashboard.
   - Displays detailed information about the selected audit, including its status, description, timeline, and attachments.

### Routes

- **index**:
   - Renders the index.html page, which displays the main dashboard.
- **audit_details**:
   - Renders the audit_details.html page, which displays the detailed information for a specific audit.
- **data**:
   - Retrieves data from the Buganizer API and returns it in JSON format. This data is used to populate the charts and graphs on the dashboard.
- **add_audit**:
   - Handles requests to add a new audit to the database.
- **update_audit**:
   - Handles requests to update an existing audit in the database.
- **delete_audit**:
   - Handles requests to delete an audit from the database.

### Additional Considerations

- The application will use Bootstrap for its frontend styling and layout.
- All data will be fetched from the Buganizer API using requests.
- The application will implement basic CRUD operations for audits.
- The application will feature a user-friendly interface with an intuitive dashboard layout.
- The application will be optimized for performance and scalability.
